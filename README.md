# epwg.de tools

The "epwg" originally stood for "Einfacher PassWort Generator", which translates to "simple password generator". So, all I wanted was to have password generator in the web which isn't backed by a php script (and possibly logging all generated passwords).

And I ended up adding more ideas of javascript tools that I found somewhere else on the web.

This is more or less a backup of the site source and also needed to comply with the GPLv2 of the "resist" tool.

A standalone [pake](https://github.com/tw93/Pake) tauri app for Windows is made available under [releases](https://github.com/unverbuggt/epwg/releases) and the site built by this source is accessible at [https://epwg.de/](https://epwg.de/).

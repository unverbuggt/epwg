# epwg.de tools

The "epwg" originally stood for "Einfacher PassWort Generator", which translates to "simple password generator". So, all I wanted was to have password generator in the web which isn't backed by a php script (and possibly logging all generated passwords).

And I ended up adding more ideas of javascript tools that I found somewhere else on the web.
